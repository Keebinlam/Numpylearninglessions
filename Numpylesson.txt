pip3 install Numpy


Numpy is a core base for many other library like Pandas
Numpy is a multi-dimensional array library, meaning it can store data in 1, 2 3... dimensional

Why use Numpy over list? 
-The main difference is speed. Numpy is much faster. A reason is it faster is because Numpy uses fixed types.
-Numpy reads information in binary, while list uses a built in int type, which has multple meta information inside it.
-With list having, size, reference count, object type, the complete binary makeup in a list is much larger than in Numpy
-Since numpy uses less bytes, it reads faster 
-Also in list, it is checking type each time while numpy does not do type check. 
-Numpy uses contiguous memory, meaning data blocks is right next to each other. So quicker access to cache

How are list different than Numpy?
-List you can use insertion, deletion, appending, concaenation
-numpym can also insertion, deletion, appending, concaenation, except it can it across the array

Application of Numpy
-Matlab replacement (math)
- plotting (matplotlib)
- backend (pandas, connect 4, digital photography)
- Machine Learning
