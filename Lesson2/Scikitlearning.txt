scikit is important for machine learning in python

Scikit learning 
Machine Learning Process
1)what questions are we trying to answer?
2) find data to help answer the question
3) process data
4) build model
5) evaluate model
6)tune data
Scikit helps with all of this

Scikit learning is more for traditional algortimic models 
some neural network model

Neural network is better with pytorch

Scypy toolkit
It has a ton of models to test

Training split is for splitting data to Test or Training
SVC is a type of ML algorthyim
.score is to evaulate the data
.predict is to predict the new data

Typically it is used with matplitlib, pandas, and numpy

Represenatation: hypothesis space where data preprocssing and model building is achieved
Evaluation: It is esstentially how you jugde or prefer one model vs another 
Optimazation: method of traversing the space to find the promised land of ideal models

A learning proble consideres a set of n samples of data and then tries to predict properties of similar unknown data

Supervised learning: classification, regression
Unsupervised: clustering, Anomaly detection
